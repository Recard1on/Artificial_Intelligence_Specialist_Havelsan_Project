# SQL Query Development for Database Optimization - AI Program

### Introduction

In this project, as part of the Artificial Intelligence program by the Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Turkey, I developed SQL queries to retrieve the required results from a database provided by HAVELSAN. Following comprehensive database training, I implemented optimized SQL queries to meet specific project requirements and ensure efficient data retrieval.

# SCHEMA
#### author(author id:int, author name:varchar(60))
#### publisher(publisher id:int, publisher name:varchar(50))
#### book(isbn:char(13), book name:varchar(120), publisher id:int, first publish year:char(4), page count:int, category:varchar(25), rating:float) REFERENCES publisher(publisher id)
#### author of(isbn:char(13),author id:int) REFERENCES book(isbn) author(author id)
#### phw1(isbn:char(13), book name:varchar(120), rating:float)

### 1. createTables(self): Create all tables according to the schema defined above

### 2. Data has been added to the appropriate tables. In this task, no data has been added to table phw1.

### 3. Query 1, The book(s) with the most pages should be listed with isbn, first publish year, page count and publisher name. yYou must sort the results in ascending order by isbn. 

### 4. Query 2, You will list the publisher ids of the publishing houses that published the books co-authored by the given two authors, and the average page count of all books published by these publishing houses. You must sort the results in ascending order according to the publisher id. 

### 5. Query 3, You will list the book name, category and first publish year of the earliest published book(s) of the author(s) with the given author name. You must sort the results in ascending order by book name, category and first publish year. 

### 6. Query 4, You will list the publisher ids of publishing houses with names containing at least 3 words (Â¨ornek: "Koc Universitesi Yayinlari"), that have published at least 3 books and have an average rating higher than 3 for all their books, and the different categories they publish in. Note: you can assume that each word in publisher name is separated by a space. You must sort the results in ascending order by publisher id and category.

### 7. Query 5, You will list the author id and author name of all authors who have worked with all publishers with the given author id. You must sort the results in ascending order by author id.

### 8. Query 6, List author id, isbn(s) of 'selective' authors. "Selective" authors are "authors who have only dealt with publishers who have published their own books (i.e. they have not published books by other authors). You must sort the results in ascending order by author id and ISBN number.

### 9. Query 7, You will list the publisher id and publisher name of publishers who have published at least 2 books in the 'Novel' category and whose average rating is higher than the given value. You must sort the results in ascending order according to the publisher id.

### 10. Query 8, Some books in the store may have been published more than once: they may have the same title (book name) but different ISBNs. For each of these books, find the isbn, book name and rating of the one with the lowest rating and save them in table phw1 using a single BULK insert query. If there is more than one book with the lowest rating, then save them all. After the bulk insert, list the isbn, book name and rating of all rows in table phw1. You must sort them in ascending order by isbn.

### 11. Query 9, Increase the rating by one (1) for books with the given keyword in the book name. The maximum rating cannot be more than 5, so do not update the rating of a book if the rating before the change was greater than 4. After the update, return the sum of the ratings of all books.

### 12. Query 10, Delete publishers that have never published a book from the publisher table. After deletion, return the number of records in the publisher table.
